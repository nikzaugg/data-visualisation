# Plots & Running Code

- all .png files are inside /plot_pictures
- to display all plot one after the other run main.py
- to load dashboard containing the first 5 plots with the scatter-plot matrix separately run dashboard.py

# Remark: Task 5 - scatterplot matrix
- I was unable to combine scatterplot matrix from pandas or seaborne with elements of matplotlib. Therefore, they are separated inside this project. And also not inside the dashboard output.
