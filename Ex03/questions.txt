Task 1
# Question 1: What type of variables has the Iris dataset? Refer the type of each variable.
    sepal_length: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
    sepal_width: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
    petal_length: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
    petal_width: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
    species: Is a nominal variable and categorical.

# Question 2: How many features are included in the Iris dataset? Which are they?
    three features, x and y coordinates as well as the name of the flowers

Task 3
# Question 3: Compare the clustering results with the original labelling. What do you notice from the comparison?

    The training data is very good. We get accuracy of over 90%, mostly > 95%. 

Task 5
# Question 4: What should we do in order to avoid such kind of problems?

    The normalization of all values to the interval [0, 1] would allow to compare variables that were originally unrelated.


Task 6
# Question 5: Which class presents higher correlation? How much is it?

    Intraclass correlations are:

    Iris-setosa
    Intraclass correlation: ->  0.747  <-
    ------------------------------


    Iris-versicolor
    Intraclass correlation: ->  0.526  <-
    ------------------------------


    Iris-virginica
    Intraclass correlation: ->  0.465  <-

    Iris-setosa cluster has the highest intraclass correlation.
