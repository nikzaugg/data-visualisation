Task 1
# Question 1: What type of variables has the Iris dataset? Refer the type of each variable.
sepal_length: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
sepal_width: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
petal_length: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
petal_width: Is an ordinal variable which is continuous and ordinal.
species: Is a nominal variable and categorical.

# Question 2: How many features are included in the Iris dataset? Which are they?
three features, x and y coordinates as well as the name of the flowers

Task 3
# Question 3: Compare the clustering results with the original labelling. What do you notice from the comparison?

The training data is very good. We get accuracy of over 90%, mostly > 95%. 

Task 5
# Question 4: What should we do in order to avoid such kind of problems?

The normalization of all values to the interval [0, 1] would allow to compare variables that were originally unrelated.
