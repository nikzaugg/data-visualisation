'''
Select proper multivariate visualization techniques in order to present in a proper and informative
way the relationship between multiple data variables. Create a grid of cells 10x10 on top of
the map and display in each cell of the grid a vector-valued data attribute (e.g. wind direction
and wind speed) using a directional marker (e.g. arrow with length for orientation and amplitude).
Additionally, for 4 locations of your choice, select at least three scalar variables (e.g.
temperature, pressure, precipitation) and present them below the map as scatterplot-matrices.
You can chose the data values from the first hour of the hurricane simulation and using an elevation
of 1km altitude.
